## Winner: Open Source Issue Matchmaker (#10)

**Source:** r/AppIdeas — "App for getting SWE job" (5 upvotes, 8 comments)
**Quote:** "The junior SWE job market is rough. Everyone says 'contribute to open source' but nobody tells you how to find a repo relevant to your skills or issues approachable enough to not spend 3 days understanding the codebase."

**No overlap with past builds** (PromptShot was LLM comparison, this is GitHub/career tool)
