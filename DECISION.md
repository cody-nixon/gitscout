# Decision: GitScout — Find Your First Open Source Contribution

## The Problem

Junior developers are told "contribute to open source" to build their resume and get hired. But finding the RIGHT project with the RIGHT issue is incredibly painful:

1. **No skill matching** — GitHub's "good first issues" label tells you nothing about what tech stack is needed
2. **Stale issues** — Many "good first issues" are months/years old, already claimed, or in dead repos
3. **Repo friendliness unknown** — Some repos have great onboarding docs, others are hostile to newcomers
4. **Complexity guessing** — An issue labeled "good first issue" might actually require deep domain knowledge
5. **Overwhelming volume** — Searching GitHub returns thousands of results with no prioritization

## Why This Problem Wins

| Criteria | Score | Reasoning |
|----------|-------|-----------|
| Urgency | 9/10 | Job market is brutal for juniors in 2026. AI disruption making it worse. |
| Impact | 9/10 | Millions of junior devs, bootcamp grads, career changers worldwide |
| Novelty | 8/10 | GitHub has labels but NO intelligent matching. No tool does this well. |
| Feasibility | 9/10 | GitHub Search API + AI analysis. Can build in one session. |
| Monetization | 7/10 | Could become a job-matching platform or premium feature set |
| Bookmark test | 9/10 | Come back daily/weekly for new issues matching your skills |
| Uniqueness | 10/10 | Zero overlap with past builds (LLM comparison vs. GitHub/career) |

## The Insight

The real value isn't in FINDING issues (GitHub search does that). It's in ANALYZING them:
- What skills does this issue actually need?
- How active is this repo? Will my PR get reviewed?
- How complex is this issue really?
- Is this a good match for MY specific skill level?

**AI can do this analysis.** Feed it the issue body + repo README + recent activity, and it can give you a meaningful match score and complexity estimate.

## The User

Sarah, 26, bootcamp grad. She knows React and Node.js. She's been job hunting for 3 months. Every rejection says "need more experience." She's been told to contribute to open source but spent 4 hours last weekend scrolling GitHub and gave up overwhelmed. She'd come back to this app every morning with her coffee.
